A friend took us here and order chicken boti - which I never heard - it’s basically chicken thighs; the garlic naan, lamb curry and chicken are definitely delicious. Must try. So don’t think of mutton boti - this boti is completely different.

If you're on the fence whether to go to the shoreline location on mountain view. Go there instead. It's definitely a better run kitchen flavor wise. More consistent and I think a little bit more qty too. It's at least 10% more cost at the Palo Alto location.

As for the food. Mountain view is alwayyzzzzzzz spot on. Palo Alto like to put a ton, and I mean a TON of black pepper. It's not balanced like it is in mountain view. Also the filling like the cabbage is a bit overwhelming in Palo Alto. Zareens Palo Alto, tighten it up!

Quality isn't in question. Definitely fresh ingredients
Chicken is definitely better in mountain view. Try the burrito wrap in mountain view.

I’m genuinely surprised by the number of positive reviews for this restaurant. I’m not sure how the ambiance is inside, but the outdoor area was just average. We ordered the Chicken Zinger Burger, Chicken Boti Sizzler, and Tandoori Burger—and honestly, they were all quite bland. No salt, no spice—just lacking flavor overall.

The so-called “sizzler” didn’t even sizzle. I had to double-check if that was really what we ordered—it looked more like a mess than a proper dish. Definitely not something I’d try again.
